# Desktop Clock

● Motivation and Objective:   
 Use real-time operating system-like skills to realize embedded objects around life.  
 Utilizing STM32 Board with LCD Display to Implement Desktop Clock Functionality.  
1. LCD screen can display the current time, date, temperature.  
2.On the hour, the buzzer will sound a short tone to announce the time.  
3.There will be a wake-up alarm clock at specific time, and the buzzer will make a long sound. You need to press the button to turn off the alarm clock.  

● Materials:  
STM32F407G-DISC1, LCD screen(IIC / I2C 1602 LCD), Clock module(DS3231 AT24C32), Buzzer
